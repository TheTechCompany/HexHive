With the recent lockdown in New Zealand remote collaboration is at the forefront of everyone's minds again, HexHive has been in the process of pivoting to focus on integrations so it seemed like a perfect time to integrate with one of the best open source products out there, Matrix. 

You can now add a Matrix appliance to your workspace and you and your bubble can get in touch without leaving HexHive, there is also a Jitsi capacity server so you can run video conferencing through a secure platform.
